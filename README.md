# Car-Sales-Project
A project to analyse a company's used cars sales data and build a predictive model to predict the price of cars

After visualizing,analysing, and building a model to predict the price of the used cars, we can say that:

Diesel cars are the most number of car for sale and have high price too, followed by petrol cars

There are more manual cars for sale but automatic cars have highest price

Maruti, Hyundai and Honda car Brands are in top 3 cars for sale

Less driven cars have high price

First Owner type cars are the most number of cars for sale and they have the highest price too

Mileage and Kilometers driven has a negative correlation with the price of cars, in other words the price decreases as these features increase

Engine, Power and Seats has a positive correlation with the price of cars, in other words the price increases as these features increase

Cultus VXR,Alto and Corolla GLI car model are top 3 car model for sale

Most of the cars were registered for sale in the year between 2009-2018

Price of Cars registered between 2009 and 2016 went up the most, with 2015 being the peak

Price of new cars is the top determining factor to consider when fixing the price for used cars

Linear Regression Model would be recommended to predict the price of used cars as it has a better performance than the tree based models

Gradient Boosting Regressor is the best performing tree based model
